// working - fix task sid (right now every service have the same id)
- change method of company id's, do it like tasks or array.length

- Make interface to modify status of added services
//working- create page where you can see details of service
- task page, create method to let report given service
    - create reducer which contain 3 arrays to contain active,history, all tasks
    - task main page should contain actual list of tasks, make possible pagination
    






Changes to be made from orginal:
- Let delete services, deleted services will be stored and separated from active/ongoing
- this can be made by making copy of companies
